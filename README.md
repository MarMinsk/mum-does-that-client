### Introduction

The brief for this project was to create a full-stack  web app on the topic of our choice using a Rails API, RESTful resources and authentication. 


A hosted version of the app can be found [here] (https://limitless-waters-27769.herokuapp.com/) and the code for the app can be found [here] (https://github.com/MarMinsk/Storyline).

###About the project
Our final module introduced us to Ruby on Rails and further exposure to object oriented programming, as well as SQL and relational databases, and furthered our exposure to token-based authentication. 

For my final project, I wanted to create something that addressed a real-world problem that I had identified from the work I had done with mums on maternity leave who were considering a move into a tech career. I had become aware that there is a large group of women on career breaks who are keen to share and utilize their professional skills but are not in a position to go back into the workforce in a regular way. On the other side, there are a number of small companies, start-ups, charities and social enterprises who need professional skills and advice but only on an ad hoc basis. I realised that there was a gap in the market for a tool that could connect these two groups. 


### Project overview

To help connect highly skilled women with organisations that need their expertise, I created a site called ‘Mum Does That’, which is a skills and knowledge sharing platform for professional women on career breaks. Users can list skills they are happy to offer to other users or post details of task on which they need assistance. 

The site aims to be a hub for highly skilled female professionals to share knowledge and experience with organisations or other individuals that need them.

### Wireframing

I again used Balsamiq for developing the basic wireframes for this project. Although Balsamiq isn't the most versatile of wireframing tools, I had become very familiar with the functionality throug using it for my previous GA projects so I was happy to continue using Balsamiq to quickly mock up the basic structure of the site.

### Managing the project workflow

I used Trello to manage my task workflow for this project. Although I have had a good amount of experience using Trello in many other team-based work projects, this was the first time I had use the tool for my own personal software development project. This was an interesting experience and, although I don't think I used Trello to its full effect on this project, I thought it was a useful activity to get into the discipline of organising my tasks and visualising the activities I needed to complete for the project.

My GA Instructor, Alex Chin, provided a great deal of assistance with the development of the logic for the skills selection and my Teaching Assistant, Natalie Huitson, was very helpful in designing and producing the site logo.
